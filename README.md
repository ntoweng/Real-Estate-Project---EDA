One of your clients is a large real estate investment company. They invest in houses, appartments and condos within a small county in New York state. As a part of their business, they want to try and predict the fair transaction price of a property before it's sold.
Current solution: The company currently uses a third party appraisal service. Appraisers are professionals who visit a property and estimate a fair price using their expertise or their own sets of metrics and checklists. Unfortunately, the skill levels of appraisers can vary greatly. The company compared the appraiser prices to actual transaction prices and they found that the estimates given by the inexperienced appraisers were off by $70,000 on average.
My role is to find a data driven approach to value properties. They currently have a dataset for transaction prices for previously sold properties on the market and your goal is to build a real estate pricing model using that dataset.
My final goal is to build a model to predict transaction prices with an average error of under $70,000.
